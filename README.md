# Elm Starter Template

Welcome to the Elm Starter Template! ðŸŒŸ

Are you ready to kickstart your next Elm project with ease? This template has
got you covered! It's packed with everything you need to get started quickly
and efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Index.html Setup

The `index.html` file in this template is configured to send the initial width
and height of the window to the Elm app. This ensures that your app can adapt
to different screen sizes right from the start.

### Elm App Initialization

In the Elm app, we've included some starter code that makes use of the initial
width and height data sent from the `index.html`. This allows you to hit the
ground running and focus on building your application logic without worrying
about setting up basic functionality.

## MakeFile Commands

We've provided a `MakeFile` with two handy directives: `live` and `build`.

### Live Development

The `live` directive is perfect for live development. Simply run:

```bash make live ```

This command utilizes `elm-live`, which you can install easily with:

```bash npm install elm-live ```

### Build for Production

Need to build your Elm app for production? No problem! Just run:

```bash make build ```

And that's it! Your Elm app will be ready for deployment.

## Conclusion

With this Elm Starter Template, starting a new Elm project has never been
easier. Whether you're building a small prototype or a large-scale application,
this template provides the foundation you need to hit the ground running and
build something amazing. Happy coding! ðŸš€
